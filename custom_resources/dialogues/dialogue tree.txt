Hey champ, welcome to Sizzle!

I'm here to help you through your first few dishes.

Let's start off simple. Go ahead and grab that raw steak on the table over there, and slap it down on your plate.

Great! You're a real raw steak serving pro. I usually prefer cooked meat, though. Let's go ahead and fix up a plate of grilled kebabs.

Slice meat by putting it on the cutting board. Once it's sliced, go ahead and put it on the table next to the plate, drag a skewer over to the sliced meat, and bam.
Then put that sucker on the grill and char it up! I want three kebabs on that plate.

Oh boy, smells delicious! You're doing great. Now let's make something a bit more complex.

It's time for Spaghetti!
First, boil some noodles in that there saucepan. Then, slice and cook the meat in the skillet for some delicious meatballs.
Make some tomato sauce by sticking tomatos and garlic in the saucepan.
and finally, combine in that order into your bowl, and top with some nice fresh herbs.
